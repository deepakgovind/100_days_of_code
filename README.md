# 100_days_of_code
<h2>Motivation</h2>
I've decided to take the 100 days of code challenge because I want to develop a coding study routine and improve my tech skills. I love computing and I believe the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me to become a better programmer!
If it's your first Hacktober Fest and you're feeling a bit nervous or unsure, this is a great place to do a test run! You can use this repo as an oportunity to get familiar with contributing via Pull Requests (PRs).
